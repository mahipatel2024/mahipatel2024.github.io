                        <p> Lisbon and Sintra (2023) </p>
                        <p>Portugal is a country that effortlessly blends centuries-old history with breathtaking landscapes. During my recent trip, I had the pleasure of exploring Lisbon and the magical town of Sintra. With the help of Lisbon's iconic yellow tour bus, I discovered stunning landmarks, including the Sanctuary of Christ the King, and later ventured into Sintra to visit the awe-inspiring Monserrate Palace and the majestic Pena Palace.</p>
                        <p>After soaking up the city vibes on the yellow bus in Lisbon, I embarked on a day trip to Sintra, a charming town nestled in the foothills of the Sintra Mountains. Known for its fairy-tale palaces and lush gardens, Sintra feels like stepping into another world, and it's no wonder this town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. </p>
                        <blockquote>"Sintra is truly amazing" - <cite>Mahi, 2024</cite></blockquote>
                        <p>The Monserrate Palace, a place that feels like it was pulled straight out of a fantasy novel. Surrounded by exotic gardens, this palace is an architectural marvel that blends Moorish, Gothic, and Indian influences. The intricately detailed arches, colorful domes, and romantic ambiance make it one of the most beautiful palaces I’ve ever seen. Pena Palace is high on a hilltop. This colourful, whimsical palace is one of Portugal’s most famous landmarks. The mix of vivid yellows, reds, and purples gives it a dream-like quality, and its design is a mix of Renaissance, Gothic, and Moorish styles.</p>

                        <p> Spain - Aug 2017 </p>
                        <p> One of the highlights of my visit was the Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias (City of Arts and Sciences), a futuristic complex designed by Santiago Calatrava. Walking through this architectural marvel felt like stepping into a sci-fi movie. The ultra-modern structures, surrounded by serene reflecting pools, contrast sharply with the historic buildings found in other parts of the city. Valencia’s old town is equally captivating, with its winding cobblestone streets and centuries-old buildings. </p>
        
                        <p>The most memorable part of Madrid for me was seeing a flamenco show. Flamenco isn’t just a dance – it’s full of feeling and passion. The dancers were super energetic, and the music and singing made it even better. The clapping, fast steps, and spinning dresses filled the room with excitement. You could see the performers were giving it their all.</p>
                        
                        <p>In Barcelona,La Sagrada Família, the world-famous basilica is designed by the visionary architect Antoni Gaudí.Seeing La Sagrada Família in person is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The basilica’s towering spires seem to reach for the sky, and the intricate details of the facade tell stories of faith and nature. Inside, the stained glass windows cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the walls, creating a tranquil and almost otherworldly atmosphere. Gaudí’s vision of intertwining organic forms with religious symbolism is unlike anything I’ve seen before, and I spent hours just absorbing the beauty of it all.</p>

                        <p> France - 2014  </p>
                        <p> My journey started in Paris, a city that needs no introduction. Known for its art, fashion, and history, Paris is as magical as people say. I kicked off my trip with a visit to the Eiffel Tower, of course. Seeing it in person, especially lit up at night, was an unforgettable experience. Taking in the view from the top gave me a whole new perspective on the city.</p>
        
                        <p>Next on my list was the Louvre Museum, home to some of the most famous artwork in the world, including the Mona Lisa. Even if you're not an art expert, the sheer size and beauty of the museum itself are worth the visit. I spent hours wandering through its halls, but honestly, you could spend days and not see everything.Walking along the Seine River was another highlight. </p>
                        
                        <p>France is a country that truly has something for everyone. Whether you're looking for history, culture, scenic beauty, or luxury, it’s all here. Paris dazzles with its art and iconic sights, Provence offers a peaceful retreat into nature, and the French Riviera is a slice of Mediterranean paradise.
